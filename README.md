# Audio Stitcher
A very simply audio stitcher to make mass uploading roblox audios easier

## How to use
Run `node index.js` to initialize everything first

Place all your audios in ogg format inside the input folder, then run `node index.js`, a bunch of files will spit out in the output folder with a naming scheme of `output-index.extension`, first is the ogg output, which is a audio with all your audios stitched together,
aswell as 2 json and lua files, both of these files contain the mappings for where audios start and where they end
